    <p>
      Hey, so apparently I got some people ripping my sites and uploading it to
      their own.
      <br />
      Or, even lazier, redirecting their domains to my server.

  <div class="body-textbox body-textbox-TheSolution">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>

    <p>
      For the people redirecting their domain to my server, I set up another
      VirtualHost in Apache that had a higher priority than kaka.moe that just
      links to a <a href="http://forgehe.com/404">404 page</a>. Easy enough.
      <br />
      For the people who put in the effort to download the resources and rehost
      them, idk.
      <br />
